          <p class="artifact-annotation">I got into photography in the summer of 2023, and for autumn quarter I decided to
          create a space where I can place all of my favorite photos for me and other to view.
          Photography and film are two nascent hobbies of mine that I look forward to continuously
          developing during my time in university. Photography and film are unique mediums because
          of how much information they convey without using any words. As I develop my technical and
          creative skillsets further during my time at university, photos and videos will serve as
          small snapshots across the years. Building this gallery was also a fun technical challenge 
          and I look forward to improving it over time.</p>

      <p class="artifact-annotation center-text">In August of 2022, I purchased the house
      located at 7360 16th Ave NW after creating a business plan and raising investment
      for my real estate development company: Pax Property LLC. One year later, 1515 NW 75th st
      has completed construction and both homes are listed for sale. I learned an incredible
      amount from this project and it has also reinforced my self-image dramatically. To bring this
      from idea to reality I worked with teams of contractors, lawyers, investors, and friends and
      the skills I've gained from this project will help me in all future endevors.</p>
