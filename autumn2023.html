          <p class="artifact-annotation">I got into photography in the summer of 2023, and for autumn quarter I decided to
          create a space where I can place all of my favorite photos for me and others to view.
          Photography and film are two nascent hobbies of mine that I look forward to continuously
          developing during my time in university. Photography and film are unique mediums because
          of how much information they convey without using any words. As I curate this gallery, I
          look forward to developing photography as a means to express myself and the way that I look at
          the world.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, as I develop my technical and
          creative skillsets further during my time at university, photos and videos will serve as
          small snapshots across the years. Finally, building this gallery was a fun technical challenge 
          and I look forward to improving it over time.</p>

      <p class="artifact-annotation center-text">In August of 2022, I purchased the house
      located at 7360 16th Ave NW after creating a business plan and raising investment
      for my real estate development company: Pax Property LLC. One year later, 1515 NW 75Th St
      has completed construction and both homes are listed for sale. I learned an incredible
      amount from this project about business, construction and the value of connections. To bring this
      from idea to reality I worked with teams of contractors, lawyers, investors, and friends.
      Starting and running a business is no easy task, but I have always loved entrepreneurship,
      and my success in this endeavor has taught me what it takes to run a business.</p>

        <p class="gym-element artifact-annotation">Learning how to balance my school workload with my mental and physical has been a key part of this quarter.
          For me, this includes healthy eating, sleeping, and consistency in the gym. This 375lb deadlift that I completed
          at 140lb bodyweight represents the fruit of my labors this quarter. To get here I've needed to learn about nutrition,
          proper training, injury prevention and rehabilitation, while developing consistency and discipline for this activity.
          The gym is one facet of a lifelong pursuit of healthy living, which is something I have learned is paramount for consistency
          and stability in all areas of life. If we don't prioritize our physical and mental health, everything else suffers.
